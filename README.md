# SNAPP Working Group on climate-resilient fisheries

This is the GitHub repository for https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12790 associated with the [SNAPP Working Group on climate-resilient fisheries](https://snappartnership.net/teams/climate-resilient-fisheries/). 

The associated Climate-Resilient Fisheries Planning Tool can be found at (https://ClimateResilientFisheries.net/)


The group was lead by Kathy Mills (GMRI), Kristin Kleisner (EDF), and Patrick Sullivan (Cornell) and includes fisheries experts and practitioners from nearly every continent. The goal of the working group was to address the following three questions:

1. What key features make fisheries inherently resilient to the effects of climate change?
2. What approaches and tools confer resilience for fishery systems affected by climate change?
3. How can practitioners diagnose system resilience and identify ways in which resilience can be supported in order to enhance sustainability, economic benefits, and human well-being and equity?
