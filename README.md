**Overview**

This repository contains the data and scripts used for generating the four main figures featured in our manuscript [Diverse pathways for climate resilience in marine fishery  systems](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12790) published in _Fish and Fisheries_ (doi:10.1111/faf.12790). This publication is a product of the SNAPP Working Group on Climate Resilient Fisheries. 

Our associated resilience planning tool is available at: https://ClimateResilientFisheries.net/


**About the SNAPP Working Group on Climate Resilient Fisheries**

The [SNAPP Working Group on Climate Resilient Fisheries](https://snappartnership.net/teams/climate-resilient-fisheries/) was lead by Kathy Mills (GMRI), Kristin Kleisner (EDF), and Patrick Sullivan (Cornell) and includes fisheries experts and practitioners from nearly every continent. The goal of the working group was to address the following three questions:

1. What key features make fisheries inherently resilient to the effects of climate change?
2. What approaches and tools confer resilience for fishery systems affected by climate change?
3. How can practitioners diagnose system resilience and identify ways in which resilience can be supported in order to enhance sustainability, economic benefits, and human well-being and equity?


**Below is a breakdown of the repository's three key folders and their contents:**

1. clean_data
The clean_data folder houses the cleaned dataset and metadata essential for our analysis. 
2. figures
Within the figures folder, you'll find graphical representations or plots derived from our data. This includes the visualizations that form the basis for the four main figures in the manuscript.
3. scripts
The scripts folder is home to the R scripts responsible for analysis, and visualization. These scripts generate the 4 figures found in the main manuscript.

Note: Should you have interest in the supplemental analyses and figures, please reach out. We can provide access to additional code or data as needed. Our other associated publication *Mason et al. 2023* is available at (https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12630).
