The CDQ program operates on slightly less restrictive rules than when harvesters are fishing on non-CDQ quota, but they apply to the BSAI as a whole rather than a localized area around a community. I included B because there are some special allocations directly to communities/native corporations (Aleut corp for AI pollock) and there have been efforts to create community specific allocations (like for Adak), as well as the North/South processing quota delineation in Crab, which could also be considered some type of community-based governance.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The DCTF is a legislatively-mandated advisory body that reviews and evaluesta Dungeness crab fishery management measures and provides recommendations  to the Joint Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (JCFA), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), and the Fish and Game Commission (FGC). The DCTF is comprised of various members including commercial and recreational fishermen, CPFV vessel representatives, crab processors, and non-voting members from NGOs. The 17 commercial fishermen on the DCTF are elected by their peers and represent each port complex and production level.

The DCFGWG was convened by the CDFW in partnership with OPC and NMFS to address the increase in whale entanglements in Dungeness crab fishing gear. The Working Groups includes commercial and recreational fishermen, environmental organization representatives, members of the disentanglement network, and state and federal agencies. The case study author does not know how members are appointed to the Working Group.

The author of this case study suspects that participation in governance is limited more by the limited number of seats available to members of each stakeholder group and the interest-levels of stakeholders in participating in governance in this capacity than by the factors named here.

Harvest is limited to permitted vessels and to male crabs larger than 6.25” inches during the open season. A vessel’s permit tier limits the number of traps it is allowed to deploy (150-450).Second, pre-season testing of body condition and domoic acid contamination determines when the season is allowed to open and a “fair start” agreement between California, Oregon, and Washington protects fishers who traditionally fish in the delayed area. An area will be closed to fishing if body condition (i.e., meat yields) are too low or domoic acid contamination is too high. Third, a previously voluntary/weak but now mandatory/strict management plan governs whale entanglement risk in the Dungeness crab fishery.

First, during the 2015-16 season, the marine heatwave caused a harmful algal bloom (HAB) of unprecedented size and duration (McCabe et al., 2016; McKibben et al., 2017), leading to extended statewide closures of Dungeness crab and other fisheries as a result of dangerous levels of toxin contamination (Moore et al., 2019). Then, the delayed opening of the season intensified the overlap in fishing effort and humpback whale abundance, exacerbated by the heatwave-driven compression of humpback whale foraging grounds (Santora et al., 2020). This perfect storm of heatwave-induced impacts resulted in a dramatic spike in the number of humpback whale entanglements, the majority of which were attributed to Dungeness crab fishing gear (Saez et al., 2020). This precipitated a lawsuit by the Center for Biological Diversity alleging that California’s management of the Dungeness crab fishery threatened endangered species and was non-compliant with the Endangered Species Act (CA DOJ, 2017). This led to a mandated early closure of the fishery in the 2018-19 season and voluntary closures in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons to avoid fishery closures in response to stricter regulations.",NA,NA,"A - adequate and reliable data/information",NA,NA,NA

Blooms of diatoms in the Pseudo-nitzschia genus produced a neurotoxin called domoic acid that accumulated in the tissues of filter feeders and their benthic predators. Although domoic acid presents minimal risk to contaminated crabs and shellfish (citation), it is dangerous to their predators including humans, marine mammals, and seabirds (citation). The marine heatwave also resulted in the inshore movement of foraging humpback whales as a result of reduced offshore krill abundance and the compression anchovy abundance inshore {Updating}. This led to increased overlap between fishing gear and whales and a sudden spike in whale entanglements.

Impacts to human systems: The economic impacts of the delay to the 2015-16 season were large but varied by geography and vessel capacity. In California, revenues were 58% lower than the average of the prior five years, while revenues in Washington and Oregon were actually higher than average (PSMFC, 2021). This led the Governor of California to request federal fisheries disaster assistance stating -- before the fishery was even reopened -- that the delay had cost an estimated $48.3 million in direct economic impacts (Brown, 2016). A re-analysis that more accurately considered population size and spillovers into non-crab fisheries estimated that losses were closer to $26.1 million, with losses coming from the Dungeness crab fishery and other non-crab fisheries in approximately equal proportions (Holland and Leonard, 2020). Although this estimate is closer to the $25 million of disaster aid ultimately appropriated by Congress (Thom, 2018), the aid was not distributed to affected harvesters, processors, and dealers until more than three years after the disaster (Bonham, 2018). Furthermore, smaller vessels -- potentially limited by their mobility -- were disproportionately impacted by the delay (Jardine et al., 2020) yet received less disaster relief than larger vessels (Bonham, 2018).",NA,NA,"A - adequate and reliable data/information",NA,NA,NA

If multiple shocks occurred, please describe and be specific about which actions are associated with which shock.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The response of management to the whale entanglement problem has largely been dictated by the terms of the settlement (CA DOJ, 2019). Notably, the settlement requires strict interim regulations while CDFW prepares a Habitat Conservation Plan and applies for an Incidental Take Permit. These regulations include: (1) closing the fishery statewide following the confirmed entanglement of a single endangered species in Dungeness crab fishing gear; and (2) closing zones to fishing based on highly conservative indicators of elevated whale abundance. CDFW is currently revising the Risk Assessment and Mitigation Program (RAMP) used to manage entanglement risk in preparation of the Habitat Conservation Plan. The revised RAMP considers various management actions (e.g., season delays, zonal closures, gear reductions, depth restrictions) in response to various risk indicators (e.g., confirmed entanglements, high whale abundance, habitat compression, delayed seasons). Recent research suggests that such actions would reduce entanglement risk but at considerable cost to the fishery (Samhouri et al., in prep) and that static measures such as statewide gear reductions, delayed openings, or early closures would produce better outcomes for both whales and people than dynamic measures such as zonal closures (Free et al., in prep).

Monitoring and management of domoic acid contamination has continued under the existing management plan although CDFW is considering using disaster relief funding to expand monitoring and establish domoic acid management areas. Currently, domoic acid monitoring occurs at only 12 sampling sites along the California coast and the areal extent of delays resulting from high contamination are ad-hoc (CA-OST, 2016; PSMFC, 2018). An early draft of the revised management plan proposes to expand monitoring to 18 sampling sites and to establish nine clearly delineated management zones (Juhasz, 2020). Hindcasts of historical contamination risk suggest that the current monitoring program is poorly aligned with the spatial-temporal dynamics of HABs and toxin contamination and that the proposed expansions would greatly improve the efficiency of domoic acid management (Free et al., in prep).

The response of West Coast fishing communities to the events of the recent marine heatwave has varied by region and vessel size. First, during the 2015-16 season delays, California fishers either: (1) targeted their typical non-crab fisheries from a different fishing community; (2) targeted atypical non-crab fisheries from their home fishing community; or (3) stopped fishing for the season (Fisher et al., 2021). Typical early season fishing strategies were more disturbed in Northern California than in Central California, where Dungeness crab occupies less of a central role in fisheries networks. In both regions, however, the majority of vessels that specialize on Dungeness crab stopped fishing during the closures. For the vessels that continued fishing, larger vessels (≥40 ft) were more likely than smaller vessels to relocate to new fishing, suggesting a difference in adaptive options (Fisher et al., 2021). Second, in response to heightened risk of whale entanglements and fissure closures, the California Dungeness crab fleet has voluntarily delayed the opening of the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons (citation). Furthermore, through its involvement in the Dungeness Crab Task Force (DCTF; citation), the fleet has lobbied for regulations that it believes will reduce the risk of whale entanglements and preserve the viability of the commercial fleet.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Human: The human system has changed dramatically. What was once the easiest fishery to manage in California is now the most complex (Mastrum, personal communication). The fishery was previously predictable but has entered a new era of uncertainty resulting from increasing HAB risk, increasing entanglement risk, and potentially highly restrictive regulations to manage the risk of whale entanglement.

This will likely increase the efficiency of domoic acid management but also has the potential to result in more fishery closures. The efforts to overhaul the management of whale entanglement risk are likely to benefit whale conservation but at cost to fishing communities (Samhouri et al.), depending on the actions taken (Free et al.). The heatwave also inspired cutting-edge research into tools for forecasting and mitigating contamination (Anderson et al.; Free et al.) and entanglement risk (Forney, Hazen, blue whale model) that could increase resilience.

While the fish biomass in the closures was at or above the levels thought to maintain reefs above key eco- logical thresholds (42), the biomass in the fished areas was below these thresholds, especially in more recent years. This finding suggests that the rotational closure system may provide a tem- porary boost to biomass but may not be enough to stem the overall impacts of overfishing. It is noteworthy that, in 2017, we specifically conducted our fish and benthic surveys as close as possible following the end of the closure (and associated large harvesting event) to try and capture the low baseline (Fig. 2).

Habitat
human
Because the catch of yellowtail has been extremely small in the seas around Hokkaido, the production and distribution system for yellowtail had not been established in each sea area.
As an example, at the Hidaka fishing port, the number of yellowtails taken in the fixed-netting of autumn salmon has increased rapidly since 2011, and since this is a species that has never been handled before, demand and processing have not been able to keep up, and fish prices have remained low. In addition, the situation was so serious that landings of fall Chinook salmon decreased when yellowtail were caught in the nets, affecting the management of the fishery.

Squid
human
In the last 10 years, the catch of squid at the Sakhalin Sakhalin's Nakamura fishing ground has been on the decline, dropping from just under 2,500 tons in 2008 to 250 tons in 2015 and remaining flat ever since. As a result of this decline in the catch of squid, squid processors in Hakodate have been forced to reduce the scale of their production, switch to imported raw materials, and especially those specializing in squid processing have been forced to close or close their businesses. After importing secondary processed products, major companies have responded by only carrying out final processing operations such as packaging, or by developing products other than squid. Small and medium-sized enterprises are forced to close or close their businesses, and there are also new companies processing vegetables and other fish products. Some small-scale processors continue to use local raw materials and sell their products as high quality, particular, and traditional.

Fishing-dependent communities were actually better off initially, but it sounds like debt and unemployment spread through the mid 2010s. The collapse deepened inequities and further impoverished/indebted rural communities. Also the recovery of the banking system is in part built on the value of fish quota, so this creates a powerful vested interest in maintaining the status quo/value of that quota. 

Warming waters: expansion of mackerel population in Iceland's waters quickly becomes a major source of value, major fishery. But it erodes international political trust (""mackerel wars,"" negotiations were ineffective, affects Iceland not joining the EU). Ecological impact--stock was overfished. Other more anecdotal example--monkfish expanded around Iceland's waters and created political problems where people were catching them but there wasn't enough quota to go around, and quota holders were refusing to sell it because the fish command a high value.

The long-spined sea urchin has a long pelagic larval phase, when it is transported with the EAC, and is able to settle and persist in Tasmanian waters due to rapidly increasing water temperatures (Ling et al., 2008). The southern rock lobster is a principal predator of the long-spined sea urchin in Tasmania; however, due to heavy fishing of this valuable commodity the sea urchin has overgrazed Tasmanian giant kelp beds (Macrocystis pyrifera), and now over 15 percent of the eastern Tasmanian coastline has been left as urchin barrens (Ling et al., 2009a; Ling and Keane, 2018). Climate change amplifies the stress this sea urchin places on Tasmanian kelp beds and associated ecosystems, with past giant kelp die-offs due potentially to marine heatwaves (Oliver et al., 2017; Sanderson, 1990). The increasing abundance and persistence of the long-spined sea urchin in Tasmanian coastal waters has driven a shift in the marine environment, which has increased pressure on Tasmanian wild-catch fisheries that depend on seaweed bed habitat, in particular the rock lobster fisheries (Ling et al., 2009b).",NA,NA,"A - adequate and reliable data/information",NA,NA,NA

Some adult barnacles are removed, but more importantly, mussel spat extraction removes algae, limpets, small custraceans, etc., affecting the whole ecosystem and potentially limiting the number of barnacle larvae that recruits. Important controversy about how much mussel extraction affects the rocks and particularly, the barnacle fishery.

Between 1978 and 1983, various gear modifications occurred as the fishery evolved to using lighter monofilament line with increased hook spacing and depth, and chemical lightsticks. (Lynch et al. 2018)

In the early 80s, many Southeast Asian families left their home country of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, to escape danger and the aftermath from war.  Many chose to re-settle in Southeast Louisiana because of the lucrative fishing industry and similar climate and environment. At the time, resources were plentiful with commercial vessels harvesting oyster, shrimp, blue crab, and finfish (shark, swordfish, tuna, flounders, pompano, etc.).
