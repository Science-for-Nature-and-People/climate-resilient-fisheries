However, it's importance has also stoked high coordinattion and participation byt the fleet and high attetion by management. There has been lots of cross-scale, polycentric, and transparent management that has been effective at roughly managing the  problem but more participation and attention to equity and inclusiveness is required. Also, better quantitativet tools are required for management to become effective and efficienty. Managers are currenty limited by capacity.",This is the most lucrative fishery on the West Coast which means that recent issues are recieiving enormous management attention and statehold participation and advocacy. This supports the resilience of the system by promoting coordinatation among stakeholders and integration with management. The high productivity of the system also provides a buffer against uncertainty.,"The Ecological dimension is inherently resilient and provides a short-term buffer while attributes in the Governance and Social-Economic dimensions adapt. Ultimately, these are the most important dimensions but the Ecological dimension provides a critical crutch. The Dungeness crab fishery has been historically easy to manage and exceptionally lucrative which made both fishers and managers less prepared for sudden perturbations. This ties the Social-Economic and Governance dimensions closely together because it requires coordinated, participatory action to identify tractable solutions.",Not sure how to answer this - my other spreadsheet has lots of infromation which obviously couldn't be fit in here.,"If HABs and whale entanglement risk (especially), overwhelm the viability of the fishery, then the fishers will depend on Assets and Flexability to survive.

The groundfish resources in the Bering Sea utilize a precautioary approach based on the Best Scientific Information Available and an overall OY cap. Assessments are peer reviewed and annual catch target and limits are determined by scientists.  Economic value of the Bering Sea resources is very high allowing investment in new products, markets and technologies as well as industry funded research.

Ensuring that their livelihoods and the resources they depend on are sustainable and resilient is of paramount importance and so they have this as a key goal for the FMP. Additionally, biodiversity protections have been put in place via no-take zones, which has helped maintain the ecological integrity of the fisheries system. The locals place a high value on the importance of diversification in fishing and using marine resources. In the demersal fishery (less so for the lobster fishery, which is very important commercially as an export fishery) there is an understanding of the need to not overfish any particular species.","Strong social ties: they have very high levels of organization and it's generally a tight-knit community. Because it's such a small, isolated community, they have a monitoring team, a sydicato that is well-organized. There have been various efforts to create a network of collaboration (IFOP, U of Conception and JF fishers) for monitoring--big project and also for MPA monitoring. One of the fishers receives compensation for monitoring efforts. Communities, government and NGOs are creating a formal FMP process for the multispecies finfish fishery. Currently, there's good compliance with the spatial protections in place and the goals are co-management and increased stakeholder participation.
Many fishers are formally trained in science--have a mindset that is a bit different than other areas. They have an ability to communicate their goals, aware of need for protection of their biodiversity. They tend to have more more income and travel for holidays to international destinations--better education and more exposure to other cultures. 
They are also in the process of building infrastructure to add value to the fishery: building a processing plant to be able to fish and process new species and get higher prices on the mainland. The main export species is still lobster, but they are trying to diversify and sustainbly fish other demersal speices as a sort of economic safety net. However, the demersal fisheries still don't have a well established supply chain.",There are strong links to the special ecology of a region and the social and cultural ties to the resources that act to accentuate the resilience mindset of the people. The particular dependence on the marine resources (especially for wealth and assets) has bolstered the place attachment but also the agency of the people to take charge and push for more sustainable approaches and increased learning.,NA,"Due to the endemic nature of targets, if shifts happen fast, the species may not be able to adapt to the new regime. This may mean that transformation is necessary and seriously jeopardize the livelihoods and culture of the JF people.
