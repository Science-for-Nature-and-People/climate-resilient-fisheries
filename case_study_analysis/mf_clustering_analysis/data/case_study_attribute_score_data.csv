Case Study Bering Sea.xlsx,Hollowed/Kasperski,Socio-economic,Flexibility,Flexible and agile infrstructure,2,"The maritime and, increasingly health care, infrastructure necessary to process and transport the large volumes of groundfish caught in the Bering Sea requires large amounts of capital that are essentially stranded in very remote communities throughout the Bering Sea region and Aleutian Islands chain with little other viable economic uses [NPFMC 2021, BSAI Pacific Cod Trawl CV Cod Cooperative Program: https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=b8e19123-5e2d-4dd6-a541-5eed3c5788dc.pdf&fileName=C4%20Trawl%20CV%20Cod%20Analysis%20.pdf]. However, the large scale and industrialized nature of the fishery provides opportunities to quickly respond to some events, such as increased travel costs for harvesting and processing workers due to COVID-19 restrictions, while also increasing the risk of large scale COVID-19 outbreaks onboard ships or at processing facilities resulting in partial or complete shutdowns [NMFS 2021, U.S. Seafood Industry and For-Hire Sector Impacts from COVID-19: 2020 in Perspective; USDA Seafood Processors Pandemic Response and Safety (SPRS Block Grant Program): https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/sprs]. The recent $350 million fine and closure of an existing supply chain operation to the U.S. east coast by U.S. Customs and Border Protection against groundfish shipping companies operating out of Dutch Harbor, AK has highlighted the limits on cold storage capacity and need to move product from the productive Bering Sea fishing grounds through the ports and to consumers [Cliff White, Seafoodsource 9/17/21: https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/business-finance/hearing-set-to-determine-fate-of-us-cbp-s-jones-act-fines-against-american-seafoods-pollock-transporters].",NA,NA,B - limited data/information and expert judgement,high,no,"I'm not quite sure the answer is no, but I don't understand the definition and the mechanism.

As a Maine example that is similar to my own AK confusion, I'm not sure if people don't diversify away from lobster (or find work off the water) because they can't or because it doesn't make sense to (theres lots of money in lobsters) - but either way I'm not sure how to define their ""mobility"" here.",NA,Bering Sea groundfish

Overall, the results showed concordant barriers for gene flow in the three species and also supported that mtDNA is applicable for population genetic analysis and recovery of connectivity in giant clams. It is suggested that sea-level changes during glacial periods of the Pliocene and Pleistocene, as well as oceanography are important factors that shape the genetic population structure of giant clams. The observed deep evolutionary lineages in the peripheral areas of the IMA might include cryptic species, which supports the centre-of-accumulation hypothesis that aims to explain the high diversity in the IMA. As a consequence, the information will facilitate the conservation of these endangered giant clam species.

The largest giant clam, Tridacna gigas, is the biggest bivalve (two-shelled) animal in the world and can grow up to 1.3 metres long and weigh up to 500 kilograms. Project description.

It is often assumed that after settlement on a suitable substrate, giant clam pediveligers metamorphose into juveniles and lose the ability to move (Calumpong et al. 2003). This notion that juveniles are immobile and permanently attached to the substrate is not valid as they can continue to exhibit two types of movement: rotation and translation (Huang et al. 2007).

Locomotion (displacement of ~20 cm in 3 days) in a 313-mm shell length T. squamosa was observed by Huang et al. (2007), and adults are generally able to right themselves (Fankboner 1971). Studies on tactic responses in mature giant clams are absent.",Kiribati giant clam

Perhaps surprisingly, giant clams have considerable mobility, ranging from swimming and gliding as larvae to crawling in juveniles and adults (Soo and Todd 2014).

Giant clams are protandrous hermaphrodites (Wada 1952), but otherwise follow the typical bivalve mollusc life cycle (Lucas 1994). Sperm is released, followed by eggs, into the water column where fertilisation takes place. Within a day, the embryo develops into a free-swimming trochophore larvae. Straight-hinge veligers (~160 μm) form by day two and develop a ciliated velum for locomotion and feeding. Transition to the pediveliger stage (~200 μm) over the next few days is marked by the formation of a foot and two-valved shells. During this stage, the pediveliger larvae crawl on the substrate in search of suitable sites for settlement and metamorphose into early juveniles (or spats) within 2 weeks of spawning (Ellis 1998; Blidberg 2004). Giant clams thus spend a short yet critical period of approximately 9 days as pelagic larvae compared to a much longer adult stage.",Kiribati giant clam

In their experiments, the researchers found that the fluted giant clam absorbed about 1.6 times more urea when it is exposed to light (visible) than in the dark. They also found a protein similar to DUR3 being produced in the fluted giant clam's gill. DUR3 is a type of protein that facilitates the movement of absorbed urea within organisms. The level of this DUR3-like protein in the gill increases by about eight times over a period of 12 hours when the fluted giant clam is exposed to light. Urea is usually an excretory nitrogenous waste in animals, and most animals possess transporters (which are usually made of proteins) to facilitate urea excretion. As animals cannot metabolise urea, it is intriguing to find aquatic animals which absorb it from their surroundings. The research findings provide insights into supplementing giant clams with urea as organic nitrogen to facilitate their growth and development during aquaculture, which will speed up the reseeding of giant clams back to the coral reefs to compensate for their dwindling population.

Distributed and remote communities/landing sites--major risks if road access is cut off by storms.

A big concern is road accessibility--the supply chain is so immediate and efficient that it's a big loss if a town's road access is blocked by a storm, can't get the fish to market. Avalanches and ice have blocked harbor access for several days, but it's easy for the larger boats to go land in a different harbor--fishery/fishing company is fine, but maybe smaller local processors lose out. Long term infrastructure investment and how to manage accessibility of roads and harbors (especially considering isostatic rebound which may make harbors inacessible) is a looming problem for more remote communities and doesn't sound like it's being proactively addressed.",Iceland groundfish

Fishers would have different knowledge/perceptions than scientists (e.g. conflicts over survey data, attempts to include fishermen in survey process), but this knowledge is not formally included in management. 
This year (2021), industry formally collaborating with government to conduct capelin surveys (industry is driving force behind this collaboration, according to an industry leader).

Could be 4. Iceland is a very liberal, free, individualist society. Definitely evidence of individual leaders taking initiative and making a huge difference.

The governance system itself is maybe moderately responsive in that it's an electoral democracy, so citizens can vote them out.

Would fisheries governance be completely parliament/legislature? That's what sets and modifies the quota system, whereas management is the Minister and the Directorate. If parliament, then the governance system is moderately responsive to ""people's real needs"" via the electoral process, e.g. people have run and gained seats on fisheries reform platforms. Kokorsch (pers com 2/10/21) pointed out that it took 12 and 19 years to implement two small fisheries policies to address social concerns.

Limited integration internationally--Iceland does work with ICES for stock assessments and has bilateral agreements for several straddling stocks, but the mackerel wars highlight a big gap. Ongoing efforts to negotiate allocation of internationally shared stocks have stalled bc of Brexit and COVID (Gullested and Bakke 2021). Also doesn't seem like there's much connection between fisheries management and other coastal uses--tourism, industry. For example, invasive species mgmt completely separate from the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute, creating a regulatory and monitoring ""no man's land"" for marine invasives (Chambers 10/21/20). Fisheries management is also ecological/economic, not integrated with social governance bodies. Even within fisheries science it's siloed--the stock assessment people don't talk to the oceanography people (Haney).
